##  What is NLTK?

NLTK, or Natural Language Toolkit, is a comprehensive library for natural language processing (NLP) in Python. It provides a suite of text processing libraries for classification, tokenization, stemming, tagging, parsing, and more, as well as wrappers for industrial-strength NLP libraries.

##  Detailed Description

NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) is an open-source library in Python for working with human language data (text). It includes a collection of libraries for text processing, including tokenization, parsing, classification, stemming, tagging, and semantic reasoning. NLTK also provides wrappers for other NLP libraries, such as Stanford NLP, and contains a rich collection of text corpora and lexical resources like WordNet.

##  Example

```
import nltk
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize

# Sample text
text = "NLTK is a leading platform for building Python programs to work with human language data."

# Tokenize text
tokens = word_tokenize(text)
print(tokens)

```
